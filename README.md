# AzureTTSVoiceGeneratorGUI
PowerShell script to generate Voice Messages with Azure Cognitive Services Text to Speech

Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services are a collection of API to help Bots, websites and programs to use natural method of communication.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/

There are six different areas (vision, speech, knowledge, search, language and anomaly detection) where Azure Cognitive Services allows developers to build applications that walk, talk and interact with users like a real human being.

In this App I use Text-to-Speech Service REST API https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/rest-text-to-speech to generate new voice messages. It’s very easy (even for a non-developer like me) and it’s free for normal needs.
